	* unregister_blade_run_callback() for releasing the entry for a given
	blade_envPtr.

	* Added RPM-related targets to Makefile.PL. What a mess.

	* Bug fixes in util.c.

	* Minor cosmetic fixes. blade_disp() works now. Package renamed
	to pBLADE. Example theme.cgi renamed to obj_define.cgi.

	* Added blade_theme_simple_init(). The module is now complete, and
	only requires testing.

	* Additional documentation. Minor changes in Makefile.PL. Minor
	changes to example scripts. Minor changes to LICENSE.

	* First revision, missing blade_theme_simple_init(), needs testing.
